# About
This is just a Flask playground to get a bit more familiar with the technology. Right now I have a somewhat working Mandelbrot Fractal as an API. I could add local features to this or continue to add API features/customization to the rendered images. 

## To-do items
 * Generate neutral maps with just iter counts for coloring later
 * Have customizable color maps
 * Have somewhat adjustable iteration settings
 * Add controls to stop spamming and validate/complete jobs properly
 * Speed up jobs with parallelization and maybe better math or matrices
 * This still seems to be missing some offsets and navigation tools... also things to change/preserve scaling

 ## Other potential Python projects
 * Some kind of Django site or wiki
 * Flask soil calculator API (if I don't do it entirely in a front end)
 * IOT and web-based devices; smart watering
 * Deck of cards API, some validation API, some other fun thing
